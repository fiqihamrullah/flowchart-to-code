#### Convert Flowchart Object to Code 

 This is my old project where I assisted a friend who was researching rule-based machine translation methods. I built a set of rules to convert symbols into text/pseudocode and then into a programming language (in this case, C++). Unfortunately, I only recently started using Git as my portfolio
